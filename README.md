I'm Akin working as an Associate Information Management Officer at UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. My job entails working with data to enable a data-driven decision-making, supporting data collection, analysis, and dissemination. I spend a lot of time on PowerBi and Python, lately embarking on a new journey on JS.
